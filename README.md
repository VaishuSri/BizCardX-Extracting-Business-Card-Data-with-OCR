# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
Developed a Streamlit application that enables users to input a business card image and use easyOCR to extract pertinent information from it. The name of the business and the cardholder should be among the extracted data.

name, title, area, city, state, pin code, email address, phone number, and website URL. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the application should then display the retrieved data.
Users should also be able to store the extracted data and the uploaded business card image in a database using the program. Multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted data, should be able to be stored in the database.
